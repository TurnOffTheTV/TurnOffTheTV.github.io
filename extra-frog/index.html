<h3 id="0">What is Extra Frog?</h3>
<p>Extra Frog is a Discord bot where you can fight other people with text.<br>
The outcome is weighted random by applied armor, weapons, level, etc.
Get Frog Credits through various means and upgrade and buy new stuff.
Get XP from fighting to level up; each level up gives you Frog Credits.</p>
<h3 id="1">What commands does Extra Frog have?</h3>
<p>[user] must be an @mention</p>
<ul>
	<li>🐸help : Gives you a link to this page.</li>

<h3 id="2">How does Extra Frog work?</h3>
<p>Extra Frog is luck-based at the beginning, but as you get better it is more about the items you collect.<br>
	Fighting someone at a higher level is risky as they may have better armor or weapons, but you will get better rewards.<br>
	You should try not to fight someone of a lower level, they will yield less profit.<br>
	At the beginning, you have to get 5 XP to level up, then 10, then 20, then 40, etc.<br>
	There is always lots of new armor and weapons, and there is nowhere (officially) you can find a full list.</p>
<h3 id="3">Server control people info</h3>
<p>If you add Extra Frog, setting its read messages access to a channel stops it from responding there.<br>
	Even though it wants administrator privellages, it doesn't do anything with it.</p>
